# Contact Form Email Setup

## Current Status
The contact form is now configured to automatically send emails to `mstwentinity@gmail.com` using FormSubmit service.

## How It Works
1. When a user fills out the contact form and clicks "Send Message"
2. The form data is automatically submitted to FormSubmit.co
3. FormSubmit sends a formatted email to your specified email address
4. The user sees a success message confirming their message was sent

## First Time Setup (One-time only)
1. The first time someone submits the form, FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to `mstwentinity@gmail.com`
2. You need to click the confirmation link in that email to activate the form
3. After confirmation, all future form submissions will be sent automatically

## Email Format
You'll receive emails with:
- Subject: "New Contact Form Submission from [Customer Name]"
- Formatted table with all form fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Service Interested In
  - Message

## Features

## Testing
